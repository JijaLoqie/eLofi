## Welcome to `Studying and chilling` zone

Here you can manage your workspace as you like settings colors, backgrounds, musics and timers as you wish!

I wrote it on JavaScript, using only React.

In left corner you can see interesting panel, when you hover on it, it opens and provide you a bunch of stuff:

There is a several goals, which I am going to solve, to provide a really good place for `Studying and chilling`:
- Fix music. It works only by clicking on the button `Play` in right corner. In main panel with music I have some bugs i'm going to fix)
- Make that page public, with some domain.
- Add sounds when timer is up.
- Make more fluent interfaces for timer, background manager, sound manager etc)
